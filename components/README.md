# Components

If you're thinking about doing bugs to change the editor UI and functionality, you're going to want to create (or update) a **component**.

In Webmaker Mobile, components are individual units of code, including html, js, and possibly css, that add functionality to a element (or tree elements) in the DOM.

## Where can I find existing components?

Each folder in the [https://github.com/mozillafordevelopment/webmaker-app/tree/master/components/](components/) directory represents a component.

For example, the [https://github.com/mozillafordevelopment/webmaker-app/tree/master/components/tabBar](tabBar component) creates a bar at the bottom of the app with navigation buttons.
